# Personal Web Desktop (PWD)

This is the first frontend web application I ever built.

In this university examination assignment, I built a single-page application (SPA) with chat integration against a web socket server (the web socket server is currently not working). The backend of this assignment was given, and the assignment was to write the client-side code.

The application is a "Personal Web Desktop" (PWD) with three sub apps: A memory game, a chat app and a clone of the Snake game.

The application is deployed at https://leafy-truffle-d2f3f8.netlify.app/
